# `NIDIS_drought`

Welcome to `NIDIS_drought`, a GitHub repository devoted to developing drought impact models for the Intermountain West Drought Early Warning System. In this repository, we are working to develop empirical models that can better capture the relationships between drought indicators and impacts. These models are intended to support policy and planning by identifying key triggers for management action and improving drought management frameworks.
