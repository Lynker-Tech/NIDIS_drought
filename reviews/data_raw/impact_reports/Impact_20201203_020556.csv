El Paso County and Colorado Springs have spent $209,000 dealing with the pesky tumbleweeds.The troublesome tumbleweeds have trapped people in homes and an elementary school and also prompted firefighters to rescue a pregnant woman, who was afraid that she would not be able to get out of her home when she went into labor.Colorado cattle would normally eat the tumbleweed, but drought has forced ranchers to sell many of their livestock, leaving too few animals to keep the tumbleweed in check.  Burning the tumbleweed would be one way to get rid of them, but given the trouble the state has had with wildfires and the way tumbleweeds blow with the wind, it seems an unwise option.

Other counties may follow suit.ABC News, April 9, 2014.The abundance of tumbleweeds on the eastern plains of Colorado is causing problems as the rolling, prickly Russian thistles break free from their roots and roll until they pile up against homes and fences.The tumbleweeds block roads, collect in culverts and create monstrous piles sometimes up to 10 feet high and six or more feet deep.  The weeds grew abundantly in late August and early September 2013 when rains fell, but drought had stifled grass growth, allowing the Russian thistles to thrive.Tumbleweeds obstructed the water canals at Evraz Pueblo, a steel pipe making plant, and cost more than $300,000 to get rid of the weeds.  Crowley County spent more than $71,000 to clear them from roads and other structures.Pueblo West and El Paso County were bombarded with the brush in November 2013.  In eastern El Paso County, tumbleweeds blocked rural roads and even impeded traffic on Interstate 25 near Monument.  A woman living 12 miles southeast of Callahan said that her fences were thick with tumbleweeds and she didn’t know how to get rid of them.  The president of Action 22, a regional advocacy organization in southern Colorado, had a teleconference with representatives from the Department of Local Affairs, Office of Emergency Management and Department of Agriculture.  They discussed the tumbleweeds and explored options for financial assistance for dealing with the tumbleweeds, including federal resources and prevention.  The community service director of Fountain said that the weeds were not visibly appealing and were a potential fire hazard, but noted that it was difficult to deal with the things.  The brush is not easy to break down.A maintenance supervisor for Region 2 of the Colorado Department of Transportation said it was challenging keeping fence lines clean because the weeds collect there.  The tumbleweeds also get caught under wooden bridges and must be removed to reduce the fire hazard.  The Crowley County commissioner expressed frustration with the weeds that have been problematic for months, ""They are just absolutely everywhere.  They're like herding cats or maybe trying to catch balloons.  You hit them with the snowplow and they bounce away, then they move back in behind you.  You work 10 hours and all you've done is moved them around.""Tumbleweeds are causing the most problems in the northwestern part of Crowley County, where roughly 35 ranchers and farmers have spent an estimated $55,250 on top of the $71,000 the county spent to deal with them.  More than 850 hours have gone toward clearing the things.A banker returning from Colorado Springs on Colorado 94 in Lincoln County reported to the Crowley County commissioner that about seven to eight miles of the road were so congested with tumbleweeds that they were impassable.

The executive director of the Colorado Wheat Research Foundation, which works with the growers of certified seed varieties created by Colorado State University, said that supplies would be tight, but there should be sufficient supplies if farmers contact their dealers early.  Growers of certified seed in northeastern Colorado have received requests for seed from southeastern Colorado, western Kansas, and the panhandles of Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas since production was low in those areas.  A certified seed grower near Haxtun in extreme northeastern Colorado reported that 70 percent of his seed was sold because his usual customers wanted to claim their seeds early, knowing that the wheat crop in the southeastern part of the state was below par.A certified seed grower in southeastern Colorado near Sheridan Lake harvested only one-fifth of his total acres this summer, but only half of that seed was of decent quality to sell.  The harvested acres yielded roughly one-third of the usual amount.  Altogether, he had about 6 to 7 percent of the wheat he had to sell last year.  He was trying to buy seed from northern Colorado, but will have to raise the price 20 to 30 percent to cover transportation costs.
