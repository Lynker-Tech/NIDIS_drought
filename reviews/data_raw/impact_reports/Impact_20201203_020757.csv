Grass and other small vegetation grew last spring because of the wet conditions, but that vegetation has dried out now, creating what is known as “fine fuels”, which can be ignited easily. In addition, trees stressed by the dry conditions are more vulnerable to bark beetle infestations, which kill the trees and create more fuel for fires. As a result, the U.S. Forest Service is preparing for the fire season (which usually starts in late April) much earlier than normal. They are predicting that the season could start in early March. Forest Service crews are coming to work 2-4 weeks earlier than usual. The Forest Service reports that it is now staffed at 80-90% of its firefighting capability.Impact Source:  MediaMore Information:  http://www.abqtrib.com/albq/nw_local/article/0,2564,ALBQ_19858_4487245,00.html",Fire,New Mexico,
