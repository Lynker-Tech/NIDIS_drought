""Assistance at this point and time is critically important for producers in Colorado, especially in helping them keep their farmland healthy for the remainder of the year,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""President Obama and I realize that during this time of disaster, federal assistance will be needed until conditions improve and farmers strive to recover from their losses.""Although Delta and San Juan counties were not listed as primary natural disaster areas, farmers and ranchers in those counties qualify for natural disaster assistance because the counties are contiguous.All counties were designated natural disaster areas July 3, 2012, making all qualified farm operators in the designated areas eligible for low interest emergency (EM) loans from USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA), provided eligibility requirements are met. Farmers in eligible counties have eight months from the date of the declaration to apply for loans to help cover part of their actual losses. FSA will consider each loan application on its own merits, taking into account the extent of losses, security available and repayment ability. FSA has a variety of programs, in addition to the EM loan program, to help eligible farmers recover from adversity.USDA also has made other programs available to assist farmers and ranchers, including the Emergency Conservation Program; Federal Crop Insurance; and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. Interested farmers may contact their local USDA Service Centers for further information on eligibility requirements and application procedures for these and other programs.
