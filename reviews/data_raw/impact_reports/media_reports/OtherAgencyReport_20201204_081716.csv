According to State Engineer Scott Verhines, 90 percent of New Mexico faced severe drought conditions at some point during the last year, with the remaining areas facing moderate drought. The 2011 water year was also the second driest on record.“Drought conditions can create serious problems for many New Mexico communities, farms, ranches, and open spaces.
