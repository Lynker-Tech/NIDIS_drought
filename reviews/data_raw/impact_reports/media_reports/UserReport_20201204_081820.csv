397,Pine beetle outbreaks in Wyoming forests increase fire danger,12/12/2008,01/01/2004,12/31/2004,"Wyoming forests are seeing a huge increase in pine beetle infestations.  The reason for the increase in the attacks is believed to be linked to the ongoing drought, and the age and density of forests. In 2004, the state lost 556,000 acres of trees to pine beetle outbreaks, compared to 59,000 acres in 1997.  A large concern with the pine beetle outbreaks is the increase in fire danger.  According to the Wyoming State Forester, the hot spots in the state include the Cody area, the Jackson area, Casper Mountain and the Black Hills.",http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2005/08/01/news/wyoming/7947e7b822d2bea38725704f0020faf8.txt,,,WY,State Agency,Plants & Wildlife,Wyoming,
489,Wyoming herds decrease by 13 percent,08/08/2005,01/01/2001,01/01/2005,"Wyoming herds shrank by 13 percent during the drought, dropping from 1.55 million head in January 2001 to 1.35 million in January 2005, according to Dick Coulter, director of the Wyoming field office of the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Although the last two years have been relatively wet and pasture conditions are recovering from the drought, cattle numbers have held steady over the past two years, suggesting that ranchers statewide have been slow to restock.  Ranchers are currently faced with high cattle prices while hoping to restock.",http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2005/08/08/news/wyoming/a4696e53d22cb22687257056005d301d.prt,,,WY,State Agency,Agriculture,Wyoming,
